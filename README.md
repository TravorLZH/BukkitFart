## Introduction

This is the 5th plugin I have created for [Bukkit](www.bukkit.org), which is a third party [Minecraft](www.minecraft.net) Server that provides interface for us to create plugins

And this plugin is inspired by ItsJerryAndHarry's fart

### [ItsJerryAndHarry](https://www.youtube.com/itsjerryandharry)

This is a Minecraft video author who provides a lot of funny videos in Minecraft, including Trolling Episodes, Minecraft vs Real life, and Video Games in Minecraft, etc.

### Usage

This plugin simply provides a command to fart.

```
/fart
```

Execute to toggle **Farting State**. You can also sneak to cancel farting.

## Building

This project is created in **Intellij IDEA**, so you need to use a [Jetbrains Product](https://jetbrains.com) to build it. Hopefully all the project files are in the repository
